### Comment(s) by Jacob
Focus should obviously be placed on completing the mandatory. That being said,
when I go through to clean-up for Betty, I would like to do the following.
1. variable and function names
  * make sure all variable names are relatively short (7 chars?)
  * make sure all variable names are descriptive
  * variable names for indices may be 1 letter
2. comment the code
  * long description in the function header
