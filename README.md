## Comment(s) by Jacob
Focus should obviously be placed on completing the mandatory. That being said,
when I go through to clean-up for Betty, I would like to do the following.
1. make sure all variable names are relatively short (7 chars?)
2. make sure all variable names are descriptive
3. variable names for indices may be 1 letter
4. extensively comment the code
  * long description in the function header
